## Project Setup

- [ ] **import** and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your version**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `npm run server` to start the API.

Please follow along as the instructor uses Knex migrations and seeding to create a multi-table database schema.

## Project Requirements

A client has hired you to build an API for managing zoos and the animals kept at each zoo. The API will be used for zoos in the _United States of America_, no need to worry about addresses in other countries.

For the zoos, the client wants to keep track of:

- Name
- Address

For the animals, the client wants to keep track of:

- Name
- Species
- List of all the zoos where they have resided

Determine the database tables necessary to track this information. Label any relationships between tables.
